# TODO

## Server

- Implement ingredient services / routes
- Add proper and consistent return types for services / routes
- Add error handling and proper response codes

## Client

- Add loading states for when API requests are waiting
- Implement creating new ingredients while editing recipe
- Add error handling for API requests...
- Add form / input validation
- Add Alert functionality (e.g. 'Succesfully created recipe' alert)

## Later

- Clicking on recipe means screen goes blank to load full recipe for a moment... Pass in name + description temporarily so they load straight away

- Idea: Make recipe pages customisable - canvas background, drag and drop stickers? colors / themes etc.

# Cook Book

Collect recipes, organise meal plans and simplify dinner plans!

## Plan

This project is just getting started, so stay tuned for updates!

## Goals

Dinner is always a stressful part of my night. Figuring out what to cook is always more complicated than it needs to be.
My goals for this project is to create a way to simplify my dinner routine.

I'd like to be able to save recipes and create weekly dinner plans in one easy to use app without ads!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## TODO

- Create breadcrumb component for easier navigation
- Work on styling / design
- Simple lambda function back end
